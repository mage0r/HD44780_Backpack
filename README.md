Attiny 84 LCD Display for the HD44780
=============

This project uses an Attiny 84 to drive LCD Displays that use the HD44780 driver.  It's simple, small and compatible with a range of sizes.  The board can easily be trimmed down to the standard 16x2 size or left at it's original size for 20x4.

This version reflects a pre-release design that is not practical.  Two were made and only partially worked.  This design was completely superseeded by the master branch and is only included here for reference..

DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH UNLESS YOU HAVE ONE OF THE EARLY MODELS!
